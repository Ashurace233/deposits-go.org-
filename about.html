      <h1>About FDIC </h1>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent agency of the United States government established in 1933 to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s financial system. The FDIC protects depositors by insuring deposits in banks and savings institutions, examining and supervising financial institutions for safety and soundness, and managing receiverships of failed banks.

Through its mission, the FDIC promotes trust in the banking industry by ensuring that depositors’ funds are safe—up to the insured limit—even if an FDIC-insured bank fails. The Corporation also works to make banking accessible, transparent, and resilient, fostering confidence among individuals, businesses, and communities across the nation
